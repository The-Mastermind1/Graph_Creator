# Graph_Creator:

This program creates a website in a local server and takes an input function following these rules:<br>
~ +-ax^n (when the +,-,a is not necessary a!=0 and a belongs to Z AND Z!=0 ,n>0 and n belongs to Z)
<br>
~ +-ae^nx (when the +,-,a is not necessary n>0 and a belongs to Z AND Z!=0 n>0 belongs to Z)
<br>
~ +-alog(n*x) (when the +,-,a is not necessary and α belongs to Z AND Z!=0 n>0 belongs to Z)
<br>
~ +-asin(n*x) (when the +,-,a is not necessary and a belongs to Z AND Z!=0 n>0 belongs to Z) 
<br>
~ +-acos(n*x) (when the +,-,a is not necessary and a belongs to Z AND Z!=0 n>0 belongs to Z)
<br>
~ -+a^x (when the +,-,a is not necessary a>0 and a belongs to N AND N!=0)
<br>

~(Z is for integers)

# 🆘Use the + or - a or none of them🆘
<br>


and gives to the user a 2D graph that represents the function he gave. 

# SFML:

It uses the extension library sfml to create the graph 

# CPP-HTTPLIB

It uses the extension library cpp-httplib to  create and mantain the server 

and add HTML AND CSS ELEMENTS to make this seem more like a website or an application 

~If the input is wrong the user sees the appropriate message
